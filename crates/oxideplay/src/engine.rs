//! Main-thread playback engine.
//!
//! Replaces the legacy `Player<D>` + `run_loop` pair: the
//! [`PlayerEngine`] consumes [`EngineMsg`]s produced by a
//! [`crate::job_sink::ChannelSink`] running on the executor's
//! mux thread, drives A/V sync, applies the TUI key bindings
//! (pause / seek / volume / quit), and presents frames to the
//! [`crate::driver::OutputDriver`].
//!
//! Pause is back-pressure: when paused, the engine stops draining
//! `frames_rx`, the channel fills, the executor's mux loop blocks
//! inside its `SyncSender::send`, the decode workers block in their
//! own sends, and the demuxer ultimately stalls. Resume = drain
//! again. Zero executor-side work needed.
//!
//! Seek goes through the executor's [`oxideav_pipeline::ExecutorHandle`]
//! — the engine bumps a local generation counter, calls `seek(...)`,
//! and discards every `Frame` arriving on `frames_rx` until a matching
//! `Barrier(SeekFlush { gen, landed_pts, time_base })` lands. The clock
//! origin is then re-anchored ATOMICALLY at `landed_pts` (converted to
//! a `Duration` via the matching tb), not at the next audio frame's pts
//! — pre-fix the "guess from next audio packet" heuristic was
//! consistently 50-200 ms off because video lands on a keyframe
//! ≤ target while audio lands on the next packet ≥ target.
