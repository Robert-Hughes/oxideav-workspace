//! Output-driver abstraction.

//! An `OutputDriver` is the thing that actually puts decoded audio + video
//! on the user's speakers / screen. The player core pushes frames to it,
//! polls events from it, and asks it what the current master-clock position
//! is (which is usually driven by the audio output rate).
